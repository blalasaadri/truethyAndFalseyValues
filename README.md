Truethy and falsey values in JavaScript
===
This is a very simple collection of tests, exploring truethy an falsy values in JavaScript. I'm using Mocha and Chai for the tests.

How to run the tests
---
If you have mocha installed globally, you can use

    mocha test

Otherwise, do the following initially:

    npm install
    npm test

After an initial install, a simple call of

    npm test

will suffice.
